Mitchell Gold, co-founder and chairman of Mitchell Gold + Bob Williams, is a different kind of man running a very different kind of business. In every aspect of his personal and business life, Mitchell strives to make a difference. A six-year stint with Bloomingdale’s, followed by managing The Lane Company’s national accounts and in-store gallery division, gave Mitchell the two things needed most to succeed: experience in the business and the vision to see what needed to be changed. He teamed up with Williams, former promotions art director for Seventeen magazine, and together they started their company in Taylorsville, NC in 1989. Riding the combination of Bob’s design talent and Mitchell’s business skills and connections, an industry force was born. Today, their renowned company operates out of more than 600,000-square-feet of modern manufacturing and warehouse space and provides upholstery, case goods, lighting, accessories, rugs, bed linens, and artwork. Mitchell Gold + Bob Williams is known locally and nationally for creating a corporate culture that respects diversity, supports education, provides daycare, and has been environmentally responsible since its inception.
